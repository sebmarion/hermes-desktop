# Sidebar recent sessions

The sidebar starts with New Chat, keeps app destinations pinned, then gives conversations and projects their own scroll area.

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx#Layout]] renders a New Chat action before Discover, Office, Kanban, and Schedules from `PINNED_NAV_ITEMS`, then renders [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/SidebarRecentSessions.tsx]] inside a flexible `.sidebar-chat-section`. New Chat is active when the visible Chat view has no session id yet. The standalone `sessions` view is still absent from the `View` union; the full list opens from the Cmd/Ctrl+K menu action.

## Collapse toggle brand mark

The sidebar header's collapse control doubles as the brand mark: collapsed it shows a circular dot that swaps to the expand icon on hover; expanded it shows the full wordmark beside the collapse icon.

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx#Layout]] renders `.sidebar-collapse-toggle`. Collapsed, it holds a fixed-size `.sidebar-collapse-swap` box stacking a `.sidebar-collapse-mark` circle (filled with `--text-primary`, so white on dark themes and dark on light) over the `PanelLeftOpen` icon; only opacity toggles on hover/focus, so the button never reflows. Expanded, the maskable `.sidebar-logo` wordmark shows next to the `PanelLeftClose` icon.

## Infinite sidebar list

The inline list lazily loads cached sessions in pages as the user scrolls, so the sidebar can expose the full chat history without a fixed inline cap.

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/SidebarRecentSessions.tsx]] fetches `RECENT_SESSIONS_PAGE_SIZE + 1` rows from the `sessions.json` cache to detect whether another page exists. [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx#Layout]] passes the chat scroll container ref down, and the sidebar loads the next page when that container nears the bottom. The initial sync still refreshes `state.db`, then paints the first page.

Background convergence is commit-driven rather than list-driven. [[src/main/session-revision.ts#SessionRevisionTracker]] keeps a dedicated read-only SQLite connection and combines its `PRAGMA data_version` with the database file identity, while [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/use-session-revision-poll.ts#useSessionRevisionPoll]] polls that cheap token every five seconds. An unchanged token never rebuilds the cache; a changed token triggers one sync. The poll stays mounted when the sidebar is collapsed or another app route is visible, and the primary BrowserWindow disables background timer throttling so minimized Hermes One windows also converge. Remote/SSH modes, or a temporarily missing database, use a bounded 30-second full-sync fallback.

Session titles in the inline list are constrained to the sidebar width and truncate with ellipses, while the chat section only scrolls vertically. This keeps long generated titles from creating a horizontal scrollbar.

## Compression lineage projection

Compressed conversations remain one visible session even though Hermes stores each continuation segment as a separate database row.

[[src/main/session-lineage.ts#projectCompressionLineages]] collapses only unmarked, same-source children of rows whose `end_reason` is `compression`. The canonical row follows the deterministic continuation path while it has messages; if that path ends at a zero-message terminal, it falls back to the newest message-bearing sibling in the same lineage. Meaningful root titles replace generated tip placeholders such as `Untitled`, `Cli Session`, `Continue the unfinished task from the parent`, and numbered `#N` continuation suffixes. [[src/main/sessions.ts#listSessions]], [[src/main/sessions.ts#searchSessions]], [[src/main/session-cache.ts#syncSessionCache]], and remote/SSH bridges apply the same logical projection before returning or caching rows. When a shared row has no title, the cache sync derives WebUI's deterministic 64-character first-user fallback and writes that title once through the compression lineage so both surfaces subsequently read it from `state.db`; identity, messages, archive state, and pins are not rewritten.

The visible ID, timestamps, model, and message count come from the selected tip segment; counts are never summed. Unknown sources remain unknown until after projection, and cached `endedAt` is emitted only when the selected tip supplied it. [[src/main/session-schema.ts#sessionLineageSelectList]] substitutes NULL aliases when older local schemas lack lineage columns.

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/sidebar-session-tree.ts#attachSidebarChildSessions]] applies the same parent-only sidebar contract as Hermes WebUI. Branches, delegated runs, tools, and other `child_session` rows remain directly addressable but are reference metadata rather than independent or nested sidebar conversations. A loaded child's working phase or pin bubbles to its visible ancestor; an orphan child reference is suppressed instead of promoted.

Projection happens before local, remote HTTP, and SSH pagination so hidden parent segments cannot consume page slots. Local, HTTP, and SSH search redirect old-segment hits to the canonical tip, deduplicate them, and retain the strongest matching snippet.

The native sidebar scrollbar is hidden to avoid layout shifts. [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx#Layout]] measures the chat scroll container and renders an absolutely positioned overlay thumb only while the user is scrolling, so showing or hiding the scrollbar never changes row width.

## Project grouping

Workspace-linked conversations are grouped under project rows so repository chats stay together without hiding ordinary chats.

[[src/main/session-cache.ts#syncSessionCache]] attaches each row's context folder in one batched [[src/main/session-context-folder-store.ts#getSessionContextFolders]] read and persists `contextFolder` into the `sessions.json` cache. [[src/main/session-cache.ts#listCachedSessions]] stays a DB-free cache read — it returns the persisted `contextFolder` without re-querying the store. The sidebar groups rows with a `contextFolder` under a Projects section by folder basename, while rows without one remain under Chats.

When [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/Chat.tsx#Chat]] saves a session context folder, it emits a renderer event that [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/SidebarRecentSessions.tsx]] uses to force-refresh the cache. This keeps project grouping visible immediately after a workspace is linked.

Shared session metadata comes from Hermes Agent's canonical `~/.hermes/state.db`
projection. The cached row carries the shared title, compression-lineage tip,
message count, activity time, archive state, and agent working directory
(`cwd`). `contextFolder` remains a Hermes One desktop presentation binding used
only for project grouping; it is deliberately distinct from the shared agent
workspace. Remote mode reads and mutates these fields through the Mac WebUI
session API and never transfers the SQLite file.

Projects and Chats are top-level collapsible sections, and each project folder can also be expanded or collapsed. [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/SidebarRecentSessions.tsx]] persists those disclosure states in `localStorage`; the sidebar CSS keeps section and folder rows on the same left rail, keeps disclosure arrows right-aligned, animates each disclosure with grid-row transitions, and removes hidden rows from keyboard tab order.

## Row context menu

Each sidebar session row exposes a ChatGPT-style options menu — Pin, Rename, Move to project, and Delete — opened from a hover-revealed `…` button or by right-clicking the row.

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/SidebarRecentSessions.tsx]] renders each row as a `div role="button"` (so the trailing `.sidebar-recent-session-options` button is valid nested markup) and tracks the open row in `menuTarget`. [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/SidebarSessionMenu.tsx#SidebarSessionMenu]] renders the menu in a `document.body` portal at clamped viewport coordinates so it escapes the sidebar's clipped scroll container, and closes on outside click, Escape, a scroll of the sidebar list's own `scrollContainer`, or window blur. The scroll listener is scoped to that one container (not a global capture listener) so the chat's streaming auto-scroll — which fires window-level scroll events on every chunk — no longer dismisses the menu mid-stream. "Move to project" swaps the menu to a second in-place page listing every distinct context folder (`projectChoices`) plus **New folder…** ([[src/preload/index.ts]] `selectFolder`) and **Remove from project**, rather than a hover flyout.

Transitions are `motion/react`-driven (the same library as [[src/renderer/src/components/modal/AppModal.tsx#AppModal]]): the whole menu fades/scales/blurs from its top-left anchor on open, and an internal `open` flag plays the exit before the parent unmounts it (`AnimatePresence onExitComplete` → `onClose`). Switching between the main and project pages cross-slides them (direction-aware) inside a `.sidebar-session-menu-body` wrapper whose `layout` prop animates the height difference; the wrapper clips the sliding pages. Viewport clamping measures the offset box, not `getBoundingClientRect`, so an in-flight scale/height animation doesn't skew positioning.

Each action calls a desktop API with an optimistic local update and rollback on failure: Rename → `updateSessionTitle` (inline `.sidebar-recent-session-rename` input), Archive/Unarchive → `updateSessionArchived` across the shared compression lineage, Set agent workspace → `updateSessionWorkspace` for `state.db.sessions.cwd`, Move → [[src/main/session-context-folder-store.ts#setSessionContextFolder]] then a `hermes-session-context-folder-changed` event so other surfaces re-group, Delete → a confirmation dialog (portal overlay) then [[src/main/sessions.ts#deleteSessionRows|deleteSession]]. Deleting the open chat calls `onSessionDeleted`, which [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx#Layout]] uses to drop to a fresh New Chat.

Pins come from the canonical `state.db` projection. A pin on any compression segment represents the logical conversation once; hidden physical segments and child/reference rows never create duplicate pinned rows. Pinned conversations are pulled out of normal grouping into a collapsible **Pinned** section at the top of the list.

## Full-list modal

The Cmd/Ctrl+K menu action opens an 80%×80% modal that reuses the existing Sessions screen rather than a separate route.

The modal in [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx#Layout]] renders [[src/renderer/src/screens/Sessions/Sessions.tsx]] inside a `.sessions-modal` over the shared `.models-modal-overlay` backdrop. Resuming a session or starting a new chat from the modal closes it; Esc and a backdrop click also close it. Because the Sessions screen owns its own fetching gated on `visible`, it loads only while the modal is open.

## Profile switch and active chat

The footer profile switcher keeps the selected shell profile aligned with the visible chat run, while preserving older conversations under their original profiles.

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/ProfileSwitcher.tsx#ProfileSwitcher]] persists the selected profile through main-process profile switching, then [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx#Layout]] applies [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/chatRuns.ts#selectProfileRunTransition]] before rendering Chat. If the active chat is blank, it is re-homed to the selected profile; if it already belongs to another profile, the shell activates an existing blank run for the selected profile or creates a fresh one. This prevents the footer, Settings, recent sessions, and chat transport from disagreeing about which agent is active.

Opening a sidebar session after switching profiles consumes that blank selected-profile run instead of appending beside it. [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/chatRuns.ts#openSessionRunTransition]] replaces the active scratch run when it belongs to the same profile as the resumed session, so the tab strip shows the previous session without an extra "New conversation" tab.

### SSH tunnel profile routing

SSH tunnel chat must retarget the tunnel to the selected profile's configured API port before sending a turn.

[[src/main/ipc/register.ts]] resolves the selected profile's remote `platforms.api_server.extra.port` and calls [[src/main/ssh-tunnel.ts#ensureSshTunnel]] with that port before legacy/basic SSH chat sends. [[src/main/ssh-remote.ts#sshResolveApiServerPort]] auto-allocates and persists a remote profile port when one is missing, while [[src/main/dashboard.ts]] applies the same profile-aware tunnel resolution before dashboard-over-SSH probes. This prevents a dashboard fallback from reusing a default-profile tunnel and making non-default profile chats answer as default.

### Remote launcher profile resolution

Managed SSH installs can store Hermes outside the SSH user's home or under a different `HERMES_HOME`, so Office/Agents must read profiles from the actual remote runtime rather than a `~/.hermes` filesystem scan.

[[src/main/ssh-remote.ts#buildRemoteHermesCmd]] probes per-user launcher hooks (`$HOME/.config/hermes-desktop/remote-hermes`, `$HOME/.hermes/desktop-remote-hermes`) before the default venv/PATH locations, letting a deployment supply its own wrapper that sets the right command, service user, and `HERMES_HOME`. [[src/main/ssh-remote.ts#sshListProfiles]] detects whether such a launcher actually exists in one round trip, then [[src/main/ssh-remote.ts#selectSshProfiles]] treats a present launcher as authoritative — preferring its profiles over the scan even on an equal count, so a managed `default`-only install shows live gateway state instead of stale home-directory data. Named-profile Schedules route the same way through [[src/main/ssh-remote.ts#sshRunCron]], while the default profile keeps the existing HTTP `/api/jobs` path.

## Profiles page

The Profiles page lists every workspace as table-style rows and creates new ones from a modal that can clone a chosen source profile.

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Agents/Agents.tsx]] renders one `agents-row` per profile (avatar, name, `provider · skills`, a monospace model chip, and a `Running`/`Off` gateway pill), marking the active profile with a left green bar. Selecting a row switches the active profile, which starts that profile's gateway asynchronously — so the status reads from a pid file that isn't written yet at switch time. The page therefore polls `listProfiles` (~700ms, capped near 10s) after a switch until the selected profile reports running, flipping its pill to `Running` on its own rather than only after a manual refresh or revisit. While that poll runs (and the gateway wasn't already up), the switched row shows a `Starting…` pill with a spinner; it settles on the real `Running`/`Off` status once the gateway reports in or the poll gives up. **New Agent** opens an [[src/renderer/src/components/modal/AppModal.tsx#AppModal]] with a name field, a "clone config & API keys" toggle, and — when cloning — a source-profile `<select>` defaulting to the active profile. Create calls `window.hermesAPI.createProfile(name, cloneFrom)` where `cloneFrom` is the chosen profile name or `null` for a fresh profile; the modal stays open on failure so the error is visible and the user can retry. [[src/main/profiles.ts#createProfile]] maps a non-null `cloneFrom` to the agent CLI's `hermes profile create <name> --clone-from <source>` (which implies `--clone`), validating the source as `default` or a valid named profile; [[src/main/ssh-remote.ts#sshCreateProfile]] does the same over SSH, returning the same `{ success, error }` shape and surfacing a failed clone as an error (no silent empty-profile fallback) so the modal reports it. [[src/main/registry.ts]] installs a published agent by cloning from `default`.

## Profile detail modal

A single global modal (80vw × 80vh) with a left-section nav views and edits a profile, opened from anywhere via a context hook so future profile features share one surface.

[[src/renderer/src/components/profile/ProfileModalProvider.tsx#ProfileModalProvider]] mounts [[src/renderer/src/components/profile/ProfileModal.tsx#ProfileModal]] at the app root and exposes `openProfile(name, opts)` through [[src/renderer/src/components/profile/ProfileModalContext.ts#useProfileModal]]. The sidebar popover's active profile (a button in [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/ProfileSwitcher.tsx#ProfileSwitcher]]) and each profile row's edit control in [[src/renderer/src/screens/Agents/Agents.tsx]] both call `openProfile`, passing `onChanged` to refresh their lists and `onDeleted` to fall back to the default profile when the active one is removed. The header shows the profile avatar and name; the icon'd left nav (`PROFILE_SECTIONS`) switches the right pane between **Profile** (avatar upload/remove, colour, and lucide provider/model/skills/gateway chips), **Persona** (a profile-scoped copy of [[src/renderer/src/screens/Soul/Soul.tsx#Soul]]), **Agent Memory** (a profile-scoped copy of [[src/renderer/src/screens/Memory/MemoryEntries.tsx#MemoryEntries]] loaded through `readMemory(profile.name)`), **Wallet** (a profile-scoped Base wallet pane in [[src/renderer/src/components/profile/ProfileWalletPane.tsx#ProfileWalletPane]]), and **Advanced** (the delete danger zone). Every profile — including default — is editable; only the default profile can't be deleted, so its Advanced pane just says so. The modal self-loads via `listProfiles()` and re-reads after every mutation, replacing the former inline `agents-appearance` modal.

### Profile wallets

Profile wallets are local Base-network Ethereum wallets, capped per profile and kept separate from chat/provider credentials.

[[src/renderer/src/components/profile/ProfileWalletPane.tsx#ProfileWalletPane]] lists public wallet metadata from `listWallets(profile)`, opens a create/import modal, and only displays a recovery phrase in the one-time success state after `createWallet` or `importWallet`. [[src/main/wallet-store.ts#createWallet]] generates a BIP-39 recovery phrase with Node crypto entropy, derives the Ethereum address with `ethers`, and stores public metadata plus an encrypted recovery phrase in `wallets.json` under the profile home. [[src/main/wallet-store.ts#importWallet]] validates an existing recovery phrase, rejects duplicate addresses in the same profile, and uses the same Base wallet metadata shape from [[src/shared/wallets.ts#ProfileWallet]].

### Shared modal shell

Reusable modals use a single animated shell so dialogs open and close consistently.

[[src/renderer/src/components/modal/AppModal.tsx#AppModal]] wraps Radix Dialog with Motion's `AnimatePresence`, keeping focus trapping, escape/outside-close behavior, and exit transitions in one memoized component. The shell keeps its Radix portal present through the exit phase and animates the backdrop plus content with visible fade, scale, slide, and blur. Profile modal is the first consumer: [[src/renderer/src/components/profile/ProfileModalProvider.tsx#ProfileModalProvider]] keeps its target profile mounted until `AppModal` finishes the close animation, then clears the modal state.

## Footer action row

Administrative destinations sit beside the profile switcher so the conversation nav stays short.

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx#Layout]] keeps Providers, Gateway, Tools, and Memory out of the main sidebar list and renders them as icon-only footer actions immediately above [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/ProfileSwitcher.tsx#ProfileSwitcher]]. Each button exposes a styled hover/focus tooltip and accessible label, preserving discoverability while freeing vertical room for recent conversations. Settings is no longer a `View`: its footer gear button opens the global settings modal (below) instead of switching panes.

When the sidebar is collapsed, those footer actions stay in a single centered icon rail anchored to the bottom of the 64px sidebar, with the compact profile switcher below them and no divider line above the footer.

## Settings modal

A single global modal (80vw × 80vh) with a grouped left nav presents every app/agent setting, opened from anywhere rather than as a sidebar tab.

[[src/renderer/src/components/settings/SettingsModalProvider.tsx#SettingsModalProvider]] mounts [[src/renderer/src/components/settings/SettingsModal.tsx]] at the app root (inside `ProfileModalProvider`) and exposes `openSettings(section?, { profile })` through [[src/renderer/src/components/settings/SettingsModalContext.ts#useSettingsModal]]. Three entry points call it: the sidebar-footer gear, the `/settings` command's `onOpenDiagnose` path, and a global **Cmd/Ctrl+,** keydown handler in [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx#Layout]] — each passes the active profile so the modal reads/writes the right config. The modal reuses the shared [[src/renderer/src/components/modal/AppModal.tsx#AppModal]] shell (see [[sidebar-navigation#Profile detail modal#Shared modal shell]]).

The left nav is two labelled groups — **General** (Appearance, Language, Privacy, Connection, Data) and **Hermes Agent** (About & Updates, Community, Logs & Diagnostics) — and `SETTINGS_NAV`/`resolveSection` in [[src/renderer/src/components/settings/SettingsModal.tsx]] map ids to panes. Network settings (Force IPv4 + proxy) are not a separate tab: they apply to every outgoing connection, so they live as a `Network` subsection at the bottom of [[src/renderer/src/components/settings/ConnectionPane.tsx]], and `resolveSection` aliases the legacy `/settings network` argument to the Connection pane. All shared state, the config-load effect, and the mutation handlers live in [[src/renderer/src/components/settings/useSettingsData.ts#useSettingsData]] (relocated wholesale from the former `Settings` screen) and reach each pane through [[src/renderer/src/components/settings/SettingsDataContext.ts#useSettings]], so the panes (`AppearancePane`, `ConnectionPane`, `AboutPane`, …) stay purely presentational.

## Provisional fresh sessions

Fresh chat session ids are provisional until a turn produces output or completes successfully, so provider errors do not create visible recent-session rows.

The main-process transports still send a generated `X-Hermes-Session-Id` on fresh requests to avoid gateway fingerprint collisions, but [[src/main/hermes.ts#sendMessageViaApi]] and the runs transport announce that id to the renderer only after visible output, tool/reasoning activity, or successful completion. Resumed sessions are announced immediately because the renderer already knows they are existing conversations. This keeps [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/hooks/useChatIPC.ts#useChatIPC]] from binding a failed first turn to a new sidebar entry.
